          Fishing also gives you the pleasure of self-fulfillment. When you go
          to fishing, you respect your outdoor environment, you learn skills,
          you learn to be patient, and above all, you set a goal for yourself
          and you try to achieve that goal, and all these activities give you a
          sense of fulfillment.
